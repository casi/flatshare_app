# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing and advancing our small project. I think that's great! :)

## Bugs

Think you’ve discovered a bug?

1. Search existing issues to see if it’s been reported.
2. Try the `master` branch to make sure it hasn’t been fixed.

If the above steps don’t help, create an issue. Include:

- Detailed steps to reproduce
- Complete backtraces for exceptions/log messages etc.

## New Features

If you’d like to discuss a new feature, create an issue and start the title with `[Idea]`.

## Pull Requests

1. Create an issue and describe your idea
2. Fork it
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Test your code! Please write tests altough it's annoying.
5. Tests are all green? Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
6. Publish the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create a new [Draft Pull Request (PR)](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
8. Mark the PR as 'Ready For Review' so that we can review your work and provide comments, suggestions, and request changes

A few tips:

- Keep changes to a minimum. If you have multiple features or fixes, submit multiple pull requests.
- Follow the existing style. The code should read like it’s written by a single person.

Feel free to open an issue to get feedback on your idea before spending too much time on it.

Thanks for helping and happy coding! :)
